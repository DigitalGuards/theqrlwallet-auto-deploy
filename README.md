# ZondWebWallet CI/CD Server

A Node.js-based continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) server that handles GitHub webhooks to automatically deploy frontend and backend applications to development and production environments.

## Features

- Automated deployments triggered by GitHub push events
- Separate webhook endpoints for frontend and backend deployments
- Support for both development and production environments
- Secure webhook verification using GitHub signatures
- Environment-based configuration

## Prerequisites

- Node Version Manager (NVM)
- Node.js (v20.17.0)
- npm
- PM2 (for process management)
- Git
- Bash shell
- Sudo access (for production deployments)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DigitalGuards/theqrlwallet-auto-deploy.git
cd theqrlwallet-auto-deploy
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
```env
PORT=3000
SECRET=your_github_webhook_secret
NVM_PATH=/path/to/nvm/nvm.sh
FRONTEND_PROD_PATH=/path/to/frontend/prod/repo
FRONTEND_DEV_PATH=/path/to/frontend/dev/repo
BACKEND_PROD_PATH=/path/to/backend/prod/repo
BACKEND_DEV_PATH=/path/to/backend/dev/repo
FRONTEND_DEPLOYED_PROD_PATH=/path/to/frontend/prod/deployed
FRONTEND_DEV_PM2_NAME=frontend-dev
BACKEND_PROD_PM2_NAME=backend-prod
BACKEND_DEV_PM2_NAME=backend-dev
```

## Usage

1. Start the server:
```bash
node server.js
```

2. Configure GitHub webhooks:
   - Add webhook URLs for your frontend and backend repositories:
     - Frontend webhook: `http://your-server:PORT/frontend-webhook`
     - Backend webhook: `http://your-server:PORT/backend-webhook`
   - Set content type to `application/json`
   - Set the secret to match your `SECRET` environment variable
   - Select the "Push" event

## Webhook Endpoints

### Frontend Webhook
- URL: `/frontend-webhook`
- Handles deployments for the frontend application
- Supports both main (production) and dev (development) branches

### Backend Webhook
- URL: `/backend-webhook`
- Handles deployments for the backend application
- Supports both main (production) and dev (development) branches

## Security

The server implements GitHub's webhook signature verification using SHA-256 HMAC validation. Each request is verified against the secret configured in the environment variables.

## Deployment Scripts

The project includes four deployment scripts:

1. `deploy-frontend-prod.sh`: Deploys frontend to production
   - Pulls from main branch
   - Builds the application
   - Copies built files to production server

2. `deploy-frontend-dev.sh`: Deploys frontend to development
   - Pulls from dev branch
   - Installs dependencies
   - Restarts PM2 process

3. `deploy-backend-prod.sh`: Deploys backend to production
   - Pulls from main branch
   - Installs dependencies
   - Restarts PM2 process

4. `deploy-backend-dev.sh`: Deploys backend to development
   - Pulls from dev branch
   - Installs dependencies
   - Restarts PM2 process

## Error Handling

- Failed signature verification returns 401 status code
- Failed deployments return 500 status code with error details
- All deployment activities are logged to the console
